# number-system-conversion
Originally written for university, our teacher(don't tell him) didn't explain it well enough. Therefore I wrote this project to understand how conversion works.

Hopefully I do a presentation to explain to fellow students. I find out it was really easy to convert number systems both manually and writing code to convert.

Here's a table for reference. Also a [webpage](https://toms1441.github.io/number-system-conversion/) for reference.
